This is a small script with which you can calculate any molecular mass of any 
molecular formular of a molecule.

## Usage
Downlaod the file and run the script in a terminal by typing 
`python3 molecular_mass_calculator.py`

After you are prompeted to enter a molecular formular, you can type in any 
molecular formular (for example: H2O, H2SO4, TiO2, H2, NaCl). The script will
then calculate the corresponding result.

After the result is displayed you can choose between three options:
1. Calculate a new molecule mass of a molecule.
2. Show history of calculated molecules
